## Why learn Rust?

Developer surveys show that Rust is one of the top 12 programming languages heavily used in the IT industry. According to survey data, 10–13% of software developers work with Rust regularly.

Developer appreciation for Rust is also unbeatable. How do we know that? Well, the StackOverflow Developer Survey provides amazing proof:

- Rust continues to be the most admired language in the developer community, and has been for many years in a row (eight years? nine years? No one remembers!).
- Those already working with Rust don’t want to switch to other programming languages.

## Setup

Before diving into Rust, set up your development environment:

### Linux or MacOS

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Windows

Download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/i686-pc-windows-gnu/rustup-init.exe)

## Books

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is an official, regularly updated book for those learning Rust. It is known as The Book within the community.
