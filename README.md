# Software Dev (RUST) Application 2024

## Why Rust?


## General Instructions

This github repository has 3 folders:

The Learning Resources folder contains resources to get started with rust, and a small excercise to familiarise yourself with the syntax and features of Rust.

The other 2 folders contain instructions and starting code for the respective Questions.

<strong>You need to solve either Q1_Batting or Q2_Fractions, as a part of this application (bonus points for solving both).<strong>

You should also submit the completed learning tasks, but they won't be considered for scoring.
You can use the [**Rust Playground**](https://play.rust-lang.org/) to run your code online. While this is sufficient for the learning tasks, you will need to setup Rust on your laptop for Q1 and Q2. 

## Setting up Rust


## Setting up the environment

You can follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Make sure you have installed **rust**, **cargo** and **git** on your system.
2. Make a **Private Fork** of this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top right corner of this page. 
3. Clone the repository to your local system by running the following command. Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<your-fork-name>` with the name of your fork.
    ```bash
    git clone https://www.github.com/<your-username>/<your-fork-name>
    ```

## How to submit

1. Clone this repository, and push it to your GitHub as a **private**
   repository. Make sure the repository stays private, else all of your work
   will be visible to everyone else.
2. Start working on the problem and push your solution to the private
   repository.
3. You can also add a top-level markdown file if you want to specify any other
   notes or cite references or for acknowledgements. This is completely
   optional.
4. Once you are done with your work, you can add 
   ([Programming-Club-IITM](https://github.com/Programming-Club-IITM/)) as a collaborator for your private repository, so that we can evaluate your submission.
5. Good job! You're done. Now we'll be evaluating your submissions and getting
   back to you within a a few days
